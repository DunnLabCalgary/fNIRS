function s = movingstd(x,k,windowmode)
% movingstd: efficient windowed standard deviation of a time series
% usage: s = movingstd(x,k,windowmode)
%
% Movingstd uses filter to compute the standard deviation, using
% the trick of std = sqrt((sum(x.^2) - n*xbar.^2)/(n-1)).
% Beware that this formula can suffer from numerical problems for
% data which is large in magnitude.
%
% arguments: (input)
%  x   - vector containing time series data
%
%  k   - size of the moving window to use (see windowmode)
%        All windowmodes adjust the window width near the ends of
%        the series as necessary.
%
%        k must be an integer, at least 1 for a 'central' window,
%        and at least 2 for 'forward' or 'backward'
%
%  windowmode - (OPTIONAL) flag, denotes the type of moving window used
%        DEFAULT: 'central'
%
%        windowmode = 'central' --> use a sliding window centered on
%            each point in the series. The window will have total width
%            of 2*k+1 points, thus k points on each side.
%        
%        windowmode = 'backward' --> use a sliding window that uses the
%            current point and looks back over a total of k points.
%        
%        windowmode = 'forward' --> use a sliding window that uses the
%            current point and looks forward over a total of k points.
%
%        Any simple contraction of the above options is valid, even
%        as short as a single character 'c', 'b', or 'f'. Case is
%        ignored.

%  s   - vector containing the windowed standard deviation.
